## 🛠️ **Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### ▶️ `npm start`

- **Run the app in development mode.**  
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. 🌐  
- The page will automatically reload when changes are saved.  
- You may also see lint errors in the console. 🐞

---

### ✅ `npm test`

- **Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.**  
- [Learn more about running tests here.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) 🧪

---

### 📦 `npm run build`

- **Build the app for production.**  
- Files are saved in the `build` folder and optimized for best performance.  
- The app is ready for deployment! 🚀  
- [Learn more about deployment here.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

---

### ⚠️ `npm run eject`

**Use with caution! This is a one-way operation.**  
- Removes the single build dependency.  
- Copies all configuration files into your project directory (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.).  

🛠️ This is only recommended for advanced users who want full control over the setup. Once ejected, **you cannot undo this process.**
